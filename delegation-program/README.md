# Announcement of Delegation Program from IRIS Foundation
One of the most important milestones for the success of the IRISnet is the emergence of a diverse group of validators to maintain and secure the network. The early days of the IRIShub will test the ability of validator operators to keep participating consensus.Â 
The validator community will be the most important asset of IRISnet. The early days of IRIShub will let IRIS foundation discover reliable operators. If you think of yourself as qualified and interested in running a IRIShub validator, now is a critical time.
IRIS Foundation decides to delegate some amount of IRIS to qualified validators. Key metrics to consider:

* The total number of missed precommits: A precommit is a vote on a block signed by a validator. When the precommit of a validator is not included in a block, it is considered that the validator missed this block. It can happen when the validator is down, poorly connected with the block proposer or outright censored by the block proposer. The more precommits from a validator, the better for them.
* Total count of slashing: IRIShub validator needs to avoid double signature slashing. If a validator signed two different blocks at the same height, this validator will get slashed
* Usage of Staking Rewards: A validator operator is supposed to earn some staking rewards from self-bond and delegated IRIS. IRIS foundation will encourage delegating a large portion of staking rewards
* Contribution to the growth of IRISnet: IRIS foundation will encourage community members who contribute to the development of tooling for validators, explorer, wallet, etc.
